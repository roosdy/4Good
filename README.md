Summary
4Good is a social networking platform where you can view Instagram user-generated photos of current humanitarian issues from around the world, via the Instagram hashtags and give to organisations who are assisting in the crisis. 

The goal of this web application is to build a social media platform that allows users to freely express themselves while also making it easier for them to contribute to issues they care about. I aim to build a social network where users may feel like they are making a difference even if they are sitting behind a computer, influencing the lives of people who are less fortunate. To finally remind ourselves to be grateful and compassionate, even if just a little. I've used AWS to develop a number of cloud services that aid in the management of the resources that comprise our application. Our application allows users to interact with the site, publish and alter their own posted media, and most importantly, I hope that it would allow us toÂ contribute to the betterment of the world.
